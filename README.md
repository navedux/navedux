# Hey there! I'm Naved Alam 👋

**Product Designer** crafting intuitive, user-centric designs for crypto, Web3, and beyond.

I believe great design solves real problems. I focus on understanding the "why" behind every project—keeping users at the center while building trust and clarity. Whether it's simplifying complex flows, crafting high-conversion pages, or making blockchain tech approachable, I'm in.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

I'm a fan of **iterative design**: test, refine, learn, repeat. Each project is a learning experience. I collaborate closely with teams to translate ideas into thoughtful, user-first solutions.

**What drives me:**
- Problem-solving over perfection
- User feedback over assumptions  
- Clarity over complexity
