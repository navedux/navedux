# Hey there! I'm Naved Alam 👋 

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **Product Designer** with a focus on crafting thoughtful, intuitive designs that solve real problems and make users’ lives easier. My journey started back in 2021, diving deep into the world of **crypto** and **Web3**, and I've been exploring the vast possibilities of **UI/UX design** ever since. 

## 🎨 My Approach to Design

I believe that good design is about more than aesthetics; it's about making a genuine impact. I strive to understand the "why" behind every project, keeping users at the center and focusing on building trust and clarity in my work. Whether it’s simplifying complex flows, crafting high-conversion pages, or making blockchain tech more approachable, I’m here for it!

I’m a fan of **iterative design**—testing, refining, and talking to users to learn as much as possible. Each project is a learning experience, and I enjoy collaborating closely with teams to bring ideas to life.

## 💻 Tools I Love

You’ll usually find me working with:
- **Design & Prototyping**: Figma, Sketch, Rive, Protopie, Jitter
- **Web Knowledge**: HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript
- **Showcasing Work**: Dribbble, where I share UI's and sneak peeks of what I’m up to

## 🌱 What I’m Up To

I’m always on the lookout for new design challenges and opportunities to grow. Right now, I’m experimenting with projects that focus on voice-driven interfaces, productivity apps, and making Web3 tech more user-friendly. I’m also exploring new ways that design can contribute to industries like agritech and edtech, where there’s so much potential for positive change.

## 🤝 Let’s Connect!

I'm always up for a chat about design, crypto, or the future of Web3. Feel free to reach out if you want to talk shop, brainstorm ideas, or even just share your latest playlist.
